## 🧭 Overview  

This is a web-based dashboard built using **Streamlit**, designed to analyze and visualize sales data.  

It includes:  
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- KPI generation  
- Visual charts  
- Interactive dashboard with filters  
- Export-to-Excel functionality  


## 🎯 Objectives  

The main objective of the **Sales Insights Dashboard** is to provide a structured, analytical workflow that converts raw sales data into meaningful visual insights.  

Specific objectives include:  

**1. Data Cleaning and Structuring**  
Ensure the raw sales dataset is cleaned, well-structured, and ready for analysis.  

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Generate charts showing product sales trends, category distribution, and regional performance.  

**3. KPI Computation**  
Calculate key performance indicators such as total revenue, order volume, average order value, and top-performing regions/products.  

**4. Interactive Dashboard**  
Create an easy-to-use Streamlit application allowing users to explore sales insights with filters.  

**5. Excel Export Feature**  
Enable users to download summarized reports for business usage or presentations.  

**6. Reusability & Scalability**  
Structure the project so it can be easily extended to new datasets or integrated with APIs.
